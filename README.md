# Research Track I - First Assignment
This repository contains the assignment work for the **Research Track** course, completed by:  
**Rubin Khadka Chhetri**  
**ID: 6558048**

## Introduction
This repository implements a ROS package containing two main nodes: 

-  **User Interface node**
-  **Distance Monitor node**

These nodes work together within the **`turtlesim`** simulation environment to create a simple, interactive system for controlling and monitoring two turtles.

This assignment was completed using both **Python** and **C++**.

Below are details about each node and its functionality.<br>

## Node Details
1. **User Interface Node** (`user_interface`)

This node is responsible for handling user input and controlling the movements of two turtles (`turtle1` and `turtle2`) in the simulator. Its key functions include:<br>

-  Spawns a second turtle (`turtle2`) in the simulation environment.
-  Prompts the user to:
   -  Select which turtle to control (either `turtle1` or `turtle2`).
   -  Set the selected turtle's linear and angular velocities.
-  Sends movement commands to the selected turtle, causing it to move for one second. After the movement, the turtle stops, and the interface is ready to accept the next command.

2. **Distance Monitor Node** (`distance_monitor`)

This node ensures that the turtles maintain safe distances from each other and stay within the boundaries of the simulation environment. This node continuously calculates and monitors turtle positions. Its key features are:<br>

-  Continuously calculates the distance between `turtle1` and `turtle2` and publishes this information on a dedicated ROS topic for monitoring.
-  Automatically stops a turtle if it approaches the other turtle.
-  Stops a turtle if it's position is too close to the boundaries.

## Repository Structure
The root of this repository is the package folder, which contains all necessary files and scripts for running the assignment nodes. When cloning the repository for the first time, place it directly in the `src` folder of your ROS workspace.

### Folder and File Overview
- **`/scripts`**: Contains Python scripts used for the nodes in this project. 
  - `user_interface.py`: Python version of user interface node.
  - `distance_monitor.py`: Python version of distance monitor node.

- **`/src`**: Contains C++ source files.
  - `user_interface.cpp`: C++ version of the user interface node.
  - `distance_monitor.cpp`: C++ version of the distance monitor node.

- **`/CMakeLists.txt`**: Specifies the package build rules.

- **`/package.xml`**: Lists dependencies and package metadata.

- **`/README.md`**: Read me file.

## Getting Started (Read Before Action)

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure that **`ROS Noetic`** is installed on your system.<br>
If you haven’t set up ROS yet, check this official guide to install ROS: <br>
(https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) <br>

Additionally, you’ll need **`Python 3`** and **`turtlesim`** package to run this project. Ensure they are installed on your system. If not, you can install them by running:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-turtlesim
sudo apt-get install python3
```
After installation, you can proceed to cloning the repository.

### Clone the Repository
1. **Set up your ROS workspace**

Create a new workspace (or use an existing one) and navigate to its `src` directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/my_new_ws/src
cd ~/my_new_ws/src
```
2. **Clone this repository**

Clone the assignment repository into your workspace’s `src` folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rubin-unige/assignment1_rt.git
```
3. **Add the Workspace to Your ROS Environment**

To ensure that your workspace is sourced automatically every time you start a new terminal session, add it to your `.bashrc` file:
```bash
echo "source ~/my_new_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
4. **Build the Package**

Navigate to the root of your workspace and build the package using `catkin_make`:
```bash
cd ~/my_new_ws
catkin_make
```
After building, your workspace will be ready to launch the nodes in the package.

## Running Everything

1. **Start the ROS Master**

Before running any ROS nodes, make sure the ROS Master is up and running. Open a terminal and start `roscore`:
```bash
roscore
```
2. **Run the Turtlesim Node**

Next, start the `Turtlesim` node in a new terminal to launch the simulation environment:
```bash
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```
This will open the Turtlesim window where the turtles (`turtle1` and `turtle2`) will appear.

3. **Run the User Interface and Distance Monitor Nodes**

At this point, you can proceed to run either the **C++** or **Python** version of the `User Interface` and `Distance Monitor` nodes, depending on which implementation you want to use.

### Running the C++ Version
To run the C++ nodes, follow these steps:
- Make sure that the `roscore` and `turtlesim` nodes are running.

- In a new terminal, run the **C++ User Interface Node**:
```bash
rosrun assignment1_rt user_interface
```
- In another terminal, run the **C++ Distance Monitor Node**:
```bash
rosrun assignment1_rt distance_monitor
```
This will start both the **C++ user interface** for controlling the turtles and the **distance monitor** to track their movements.

### Running the Python Version
To run the Python nodes, follow these steps:
- Make sure that the `roscore` and `turtlesim` nodes are running.

- **Make the Python scripts executable**

Before running the Python scripts, you need to ensure they are executable. Run the following command for each Python script (`user_interface.py` and `distance_monitor.py`):
``` bash
chmod +x ~/my_new_ws/src/assignment1_rt/scripts/user_interface.py
chmod +x ~/my_new_ws/src/assignment1_rt/scripts/distance_monitor.py
```

- After making the scripts executable, run the **Python User Interface Node** in the same terminal:
```bash
rosrun assignment1_rt user_interface.py
```
- Open a new terminal and run the **Python Distance Monitor Node**:
```bash
rosrun assignment1_rt distance_monitor.py
```
This will start both the **Python user interface** for controlling the turtles and the **distance monitor** to track their movements.

4. Stopping the nodes
